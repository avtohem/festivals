        <!--
        The festival contains two events, each of which is a different day of the same festival. The dates of these events
        are far into the future because the logic for merging festival events doesn't work if the festival is in the past.

        This shouldn't be a problem in production because (hopefully) the Skiddle XML feed will never include past events.
